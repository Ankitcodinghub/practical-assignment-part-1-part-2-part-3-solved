Question 1.

• Complete IPO chart for the Question 6, Week 1 Tutorial questions:

Carlos receives 24 paychecks each year. Each paycheck, he contributes a specific percentage of his gross pay to his retirement plan at work. His employer also contributes to his retirement plan, but at a different rate. Carlos wants a program that will calculate and display the total annual contribution made to his retirement plan by him and his employer. Complete an IPO chart for this problem. Desk-check the algorithm using $1465 as the gross pay, 4% as Carlos’s contribution rate, and 2% as his employer’s contribution rate. Then desk-check it using your own set of data.

• Write, compile and run a program that defines the employer’s contribution rate 2% as constant, read the Carlos’s contribution rate and the gross pay from the keyboard, then calculates and displays the total annual contribution.

Question 2.

Write a C++ program that defines the constant PI = 3.14159, declares double-precision variables x. y, and result, reads values of x and y from the keyboard, then calculates and displays the result of the following mathematical expression:

(𝑥2− 18) (𝑥 + 𝜋)(𝑥−𝑦)𝜋2+ 𝑥𝑦2

Use the following data to check your result:

x = 1.55

y = -3.06

result = 0.0950577

x = -56.88

y = 8.91

result = -0.586493

x = 1

y = 2

result = -0.261283

<strong>Practical assignment Part 2 (Version1)</strong>

Design an algorithm for a problem that evaluates a weekly temperature. The program will read temperature values (decimal) for each day in a week from the keyboard, and find and display the lowest, highest, and average temperatures in this week with appropriate messages.

Program specifications:

The program is to evaluate a temperature entry; a temperature should be a decimal number between -50 and +50 in Celsius scale.

1. The program will use a for() loop to traverse all days in a week;

2. Use a switch() statement to assign a day name to a string variable dayName (“Monday” for day 1, “Tuesday” for day 2, etc)

3. Read a temperature from the keyboard and add to the total ;

4. Evaluate a temperature entry; a temperature should be a decimal number between -50 and +50 in Celsius scale;

5. Find and displays the lowest and highest temperatures and correspondent day names.

6. Calculate and display the average temperature with 2 digits after the decimal point.

The program output may look like this

With the evaluation of the input temperature:

What to do:

• Draw a flowchart for the program design

• Write the program code.

• Compile and run the program.

• Test the program using various values for input to make sure that calculations are correct.

• Ensure that the program code has your “signature” on the top and comments explaining purpose of functions and program’s logic.

Assignment submission:

1. You will demonstrate the working program to the teacher and answer questions

2. Then you will submit the assignment online to the Practical Assessment Part 2 page on the Blackboard.

Your submission must include the following files – all in .pdf format:

• Flowchart of the algorithm design

• The program code with your “signature” and comments

<strong>Practical assignment Part 3 (Version 1)</strong>

<strong><u>Trucks company</u></strong>

<strong><u>Problem description:</u></strong>

A truck company has a number of trucks to carry heavy loads. Each truck has a number and allowed maximum weight of the load. The allowed weights are stored in a text file in one line separated by space.

&nbsp;

Develop an algorithm of a program that prints a table with truck’s number, allowed weight, and actual weight, where the actual weight is assigned as a random number in the range of 1000 to 5000 kg

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<strong><u>Program specifications:</u></strong>

&nbsp;

<ol>
<li>Start a project “Trucks” in Dev C++</li>
<li>Save main(), and compile template to create an output folder.</li>
<li>Make a text file with any number of integer values in the range 1000 to 5000 written in one line separated by space. Save it as “limits.txt” in the Output/MingW/ folder of your project</li>
<li>Open input file “limits.txt” , use as while() loop to read the numbers, and count how many numbers are in the file; Store this in the variable totalTrucks</li>
<li>Use the following statements to return to the start of the file:</li>
</ol>
inFile.clear();

inFile.seekg(0, ios::beg);

<ol start="6">
<li>Declare two arrays actualWeights[totalTrucks] and allowedWeights[totalTrucks];</li>
<li>Fill array actualWeights[] with random numbers in the range 1000 – 5000</li>
<li>Fill array of allowedWeights[] with numbers from file</li>
<li>Open outFile for writing</li>
<li>Use a for() loop to print a table containing a truck number (starting from 1 and to the totalTrucks), allowed weight, and actual weight. You will print the table on the screen and into the outFile.</li>
</ol>
<strong>&nbsp;</strong>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The output on the screen and in the file may look like that

<strong>What to do:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Write the program code.</li>
<li>Compile and run the program.</li>
<li>Test the program using various values for input to make sure that calculations are correct.</li>
<li>Ensure that the program code has your “signature” on the top and comments explaining purpose of functions and program’s logic.</li>
<li>Demonstrate the working program to the teacher</li>
<li>Demonstrate input and output files stored in the Output folder.</li>
